# ADIP-Morphology-thinning
This is an assignment from the Advanced Digital Image Processing (ADIP) course, focusing on the development and implementation of image **thinning (skeletonization)**.
The objective is to strengthen understanding of image quantization and enhance C programming skills through practical image processing tasks.

## üìå Description
Thinning is a morphological operation that reduces binary foreground regions to a single-pixel-wide skeleton while preserving the topology of the original shape.
